      <h2>About the NASA Scouting App</h2>

      <p>NASA, a.k.a Not Another Scouting App, is a project created by
      Jake Rothfus, Luke Kaufman, Anna Bai, Matthew Hull, and Eric
      Rothfus for the FRC team 2468. The idea behind NASA was to make
      an infrastructure that allows for the quick and easy creation of
      a customized scouting app. To accomplish this we designed NASA
      to be able to generate a scouting app using an XML file, a
      industry standard file type that can be easily learned. This
      allows even someone with minimal coding experience to completely
      design and reshape the app into what they need it to be. </p>

      <p>The architecture of NASA can be broken into three main
      components: Contributors, Controllers, and the
      Database. Starting with data collection we have the
      Contributors, in our case six Lenovo Android tablets that scout
      each match and record data upon a single robot and its
      performance. The data is then sent through bluetooth low energy
      to the Controller who validates inputs and serves as the
      transmission point to our Firebase database. Firebase then works
      to provide real-time statistics about the performance of robots
      at the competition that can be queried by any device with wifi
      access or 4G connectivity.</p>

      <p>The Contributor's interface is a downloadable HTML page that
      can be run in offline mode. This downloadable page can be
      recreated for each years new game through the main XML file. The
      Controller interface was designed to be non-specific and can
      remain unchanged from year to year despite the changed
      game. Finally the database allows for the creation of changeable
      views that allow for multiple interpretations of the collected
      data and real time statistics.  Because of our team's heavy
      emphasis on our in a box methodology we decided to document the
      creation and use of this framework during the 2019 FRC
      Season. On our Website we have a number of tutorial videos that
      go in depth on the use of the NASA framework and its
      customizability. By having both Seniors and Juniors on our
      development team we've ensured the continuity of the project
      beyond the 2019 season. Our team believes that Legacy is not
      what you leave for others, but in others. With this in mind, we
      worked not to leave behind a good scouting app, but the ability
      for those that come after us to create a good scouting app.</p>
