Describes how views work in NASA.

1. Overview

A "View" is the term given for the definition of statistic data
presented to the user, given a particular set of data, with a
particular layout of the data on the screen. For example, one View
could be "a list of robots participating in the El Paso competition in
2019, along with their performance data."  In this case, the layout is
a "list" with the target data being the robots and their performance,
but only for a particular competition.  The View infrastructure makes
this possible.

2. View Formats

Views can (currently) be displayed in 4 different formats:

  -list - the target data is presented in a simple tabular format
  	  (list) with the data items for the columns, and rows being
  	  differing categories such as robots or competitions. The
  	  list has controls for sorting.

  - record - the target data is shown on the screen in a "one data
    	     item" format.  For example, the performance data for a
    	     single robot for a single match in a competition can be
    	     shown.  Multiple selectors are also present to select the
    	     different attributes to show in the chart.

  - bar - the target data is presented with one bar for each "record"
    	  of data, with one or more data items driving the height of
    	  the bar.

  - pie - the target data is presented with one pie piece for each
    	  record, with the percentage of the pie related to one data
    	  item. Multiple selectors are also present to select the
    	  different attributes to show in the pie.

2. Data Organization

The data is the statistical database is stored in a tree format with
the following structure:

  year
  year
   |- robot
   |- robot
   '- robot
       |- competition
       |- competition
       '- competition
           |- match
           '- match

Each level of the tree is called a perspective. That is, the robot
perspective refers to the level where all of the robots are
listed. The competition perspective refers to the level where all of
the competitions are listed.

In case it's not obvious, each robot has a set of competitions below
it. The set of competitions under one robot is often the same set as
under another robot (particularly given that only one team is using
NASA).  Each competition has a set of matches under it, which lists
all of the matches for that competition for that robot.  For example:

  2019
   |- 118
   |   |- El Paso
   |   |   |- 10
   |   |   |- 32
   |   |   '- 45
   |   '- Greenville
   |       |- 7
   |       '- 15
   '- 2468
       |- El Paso
       |   |- 10
       |   |- 32
       |   '- 45
       '- Greenville
           |- 7
           '- 15

3. Data and Meta Data

Data lives at each level of the tree. At the "leaves" (the matches)
the raw data from each match is stored. Also at the leaves, "metaData"
(computed data based upon the raw data) is also stored.

Above the leaves, metaData is stored at each level and represents data
that was computed based upon the lower level data. For example, at the
2019/2468/Greenville level in the diagram above, there will be data
representing certain averages of data from all of the matches
combined. Note that the "key" for metaData in each level of the tree
(except leaves) is "_metaData" and looks like this:

  2019
   |- 118
   |   |- El Paso
   |   |   |- 10
   |   |   |- 32
   |   |   |- 45
   |   |   '- _metaData
   |   |- Greenville
   |   |   |- 7
   |   |   |- 15
   |   |   '- _metaData
   |   '- _metaData
   |- 2468
   |   |- El Paso
   |   |   |- 10
   |   |   |- 32
   |   |   |- 45
   |   |   '- _metaData
   |   |- Greenville
   |   |   |- 7
   |   |   |- 15
   |   |   '- _metaData
   |   '- _metaData
   '- _metaData

An important rule that the system follows is that no year, robot, or competition can
be named "_metaData".

4. Selecting Data for a View

When selecting the data that will be part of a view, you must
understand the concept of a "record" of data. A record refers to a
chunk of raw data that was captured by the scouting system. In
particular, this means MATCH DATA that was captured during a
competition. Each record includes all of the raw data that was
captured, along with the metaData that was computed at the match
level. Further, each record 'logically' includes the metaData that is
part of each level of the tree above the match. There are many
matches, therefore, that logically include the metaData for a
particular competition for a particular robot.

In addition to the view format (described above) each view has three
specifications that define it:

  - Constraints - Constraints are represented by a combination of one
    or more of the following things: year, robot, competition, and
    match. Each one represents a piece of USER INPUT that is required
    before a particular view can be shown. For example, for a view
    that shows "all competitions for a particular robot", the user
    must select the robot that the user wants to see. In this case,
    the robot is a constraint. Often, the view would include multiple
    constraints, such as the robot and year for "all competitions in a
    particular year for a particular robot".

    An important way to think about constraints is to understand that
    all of the data that is found and presented MUST CONFORM to all of
    the constraints. So if, for example, 100 rows of data are
    returned, then each one of those rows will adhere to all of the
    associated constraints.

  - Perspective - 

  - Data

The target task for presenting a view is to select the appropriate
data for the view you are creating. A couple examples will make
this task clear.

  4.1. Best Scoring Robots

  4.2. All Robots in a Particular Competition

  4.3. Highest Score for Every Robot in a Year

  This view takes advantage of the sorting capability of the views when
  presented to the user. This view actually shows all matches for all
  robots in a year, and the score for that match. So the "unique" part
  of the list goes down to the MATCH level, so every match is being
  shown.




2. Defining a View

The simplest view is the "record" format. It is defined by providing constraints
significant enought to select a single instance of data
