Describes the use of BLE within NASA, along with the specification of the
characteristics used and their UUIDs.

1. Overview

BLE was chosen as the protocol to communicate between the Contributors and
Controllers for a number of reasons:

- Foremost, the scouting app is meant to be operated near a competition field
  where Wi-Fi is not allowed, as it may interfere with robot control. So an
  alternative communication mechanism(s) was needed to both collect data from
  the 6 individuals watching the match and to transmit that data to Firebase.

- The only conceived mechanism for dynamically transmitting data to Firebase
  was the cellular network provided by the mobile phone. So we settled on using
  a mobile phone for sending data to Firebase. We named this phone the "Controller"
  in that it not only served as the conduit to Firebase, but it also served to
  allow someone to ensure that the data coming from the Contributors made sense.
  The mechanism for transmitting the data from the Contributors to the Controller
  necessarily was different. 

- Note that we discounted the possibility that each Contributor would transmit
  data to Firebase individually for two reasons: (1) we didn't want to require
  a cellular data connection for each Contributor as it would be cost prohibitive,
  and (2) we liked the idea of having a Controller help shepherd the process along,
  noting issues while data was collected and coordinating the activities among
  the Contributors.

- Bluetooh in general seemed like a good choice for communication between the
  Contributors and Controller primarily because the Controller and Contributors
  would always be within a few feet of each other. Further, all of the devices
  contemplated for both Controllers and Contributors normally include Bluetooth
  support.
  
- BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) was a particular option that provided many benefits
  for both the Contributors and Controller:
    1 - BLE consumes far less energy than either "standard" Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
        or other forms of NFC (near field communication)
    2 - While Bluetooth is already designed to co-exist with Wi-Fi by avoiding
      	it, BLE goes one step further by taking advantage of the standard
	spacing of Wi-Fi channels to "advertise" services between them.
    3 - Software libraries for both Android (Controller) and Web (Contributor)
      	are now available...(need more here)
