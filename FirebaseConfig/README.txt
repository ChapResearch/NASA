The files in this directory are used to configure firebase for development
and deployment. Makefiles throughout this system refer to these files to
configure local copies for deployment.

For example, the ".firebaserc" file names the particular project that all
of these deployment routines use.  The firebaserc-template can be copied
to .firebaserc to instantly configure for deployment.
